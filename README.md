This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and incorporates the [Vice Software React-Redux-Hooks Boilerplate](https://github.com/vicesoftware/react-redux-hooks-boilerplate)


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Note: the frontend expects to have the [backend](https://github.com/Emergency-Makers-Network/backend) graphql server running at http://localhost:4000

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
